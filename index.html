		<h2>17 yo entrepreneur</h2>
			
		<p>
		I started my first business at age 14. I'm passionate about the creator economy. My interests are: entrepreneurship, investing on the stock market, startups (especially in the SaaS space), ecommerce and innovative business models. So check this page out! I made it myself!
		</p>

		<p>
		Currently, I'm finishing my last year on high school. I think I would major in data science and mathematics since it has a lot of applications almost in any field you could name, and I'd love to have that tricky unfair advantage (say thanks to Peter Thiel) over other entrepreneurs who don't understand how AI can power up their business by creating predictable models to increase their revenue. 
		</p>

		<p>
		This year starting at January I proposed myself to learn to code, I simply couldn't wait to pay six figures salaries to a bunch of developers to build all my crazy ideas. I needed to have a little grasp on this, but I would be honest, at the beggining this coding thing was very frustrating.
